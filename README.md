# Client/Server docker-compose 

Create an EC2 Instance in AWS with Ubuntu as the Operating System and clone this repository.
After that just build and launch. If you see 'Docker compose is magic' it means your application is working.

#How to Run?

The project launch is in two parts: Build and Start.

#Build

```
$ docker-compose build
```

#Launch

```
$ docker-compose up
```
